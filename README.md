# Sue Admin Dashboard — Version 2 preview

Preview build of Sue's Admin Dashboard with a reworked four-tab navigation
(**Home | Work | My week | More**). The original v1 dashboard is unchanged.

## Version 2 navigation

- **Home** — daily start and Quick Capture (Today calendar, Quick Capture,
  Today workload, This week, Upcoming deadlines).
- **Work** — the four existing draft-only tools: Clinic Notes + Follow-up Email,
  Letter + PDF Packer, Appointment + Telehealth Prep, and Matter Hub.
- **My week** — Kanban progress board, Health tracker, and Herstory (week by week).
- **More** — Personal admin category guide (Workflow 5), Information for Xena,
  privacy notice, and backend endpoint settings.

All draft-only and privacy safeguards, and the Google Sheet integration
behaviour, are preserved unchanged from v1.

## Original v1

The v1 dashboard remains untouched at
[`sue-admin-dashboard`](../sue-admin-dashboard/) and its GitHub Pages site is
not affected by this preview.

## Scope

## Scope

- HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript only.
- Browser-only: admin dashboard data uses `localStorage`; the Clinical Note
  Formatter and Letter + PDF Packer use page memory only.
- No client data.
- No credentials.
- No real email addresses.
- No calendar, email or practice-management integrations.
- Clinical note formatting is local, temporary preparation only. It does not log
  in, call APIs, automate record entry, or write to Feelgood or Awarely.
- Letter + PDF Packer is TEST/DRAFT only. It does not auto-send, generate email
  recipients, upload files, attach PDFs, write client data to Google Sheets, or
  integrate with any practice system.
- Any future integration requires practice approval before connection.

## Features

- Today workload busy blocks with time, practice, purpose, optional checklist/follow-up, notes shortcut, follow-up task creation and local complete/reopen state.
- Action queue task create, read, update, complete and delete.
- Upcoming deadlines create, read, update and delete, with dates and reminder lead time.
- Quick capture for general notes.
- Information for Xena form with:
  - preferred schedule
  - inbox labels and purposes, without email addresses
  - recurring deadlines and reminder lead times
  - approvals status

  - week-of date label and per-target progress summary
  - reset-week control with explicit confirmation
  - explicit privacy notice; excluded from export, import, Xena, clinical note formatter and any network request

  - practice selector for Feelgood or Awarely
  - generic clinically neutral note layout selector

    with temporary dummy/test fallback
  - editable generated draft package preview

## Run Locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser.

You can also run a local static server from this folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:4173
```

## Data Storage

Data is stored only in the current browser under this localStorage key:

```text
sueAdminDashboard:v1
```

The export buttons create local downloads only. Nothing is sent by the dashboard.

The Clinical Note Formatter is not stored under `sueAdminDashboard:v1`. Its
input and generated preview live only in the current page DOM while the page is
open. The formatter is excluded from localStorage, demo data, imports, exports
and JSON backups.

The Letter + PDF Packer is also excluded from `sueAdminDashboard:v1`. Recipient,
matter/reference, purpose, template selection and draft preview values live only
in the current page DOM. The generated package can be downloaded as a local text
file or printed through the browser, but the app does not generate attachments,
upload files, address email, send email, write client data to the Google Sheet,
or connect to a practice-management system.

Before any real use, Sue still needs approved letter template wording,
letterhead/header/footer assets, sign-off wording, document naming rules and a
confirmed PDF/attachment bundling process.

The Personal Health tracker is stored under its own dedicated key:

```text
sueAdminDashboard:health:v1
```

Only wellbeing habit completions (daily activity, strength sessions, yoga or
Pilates sessions) for the current week are stored. Personal Health is a
separate concern from clinical, practice and dashboard data. It is excluded
from `sueAdminDashboard:v1`, from demo data, from JSON export and import, from
the Information for Xena text export, from the Clinical Note Formatter, and
from any network or API request. Do not enter symptoms, diagnoses, medications
or any real health information; it is a habit checklist only.

The formatter does not auto-fill client details and should only be used with
de-identified working text. Do not paste names, dates of birth, contact details,
addresses, identifiers, credentials or other client-identifying information.

## Import And Backup

Use **Export JSON backup** before switching devices, changing browsers or clearing
browser data. The JSON file contains the dashboard state stored in this browser:
captures, busy blocks, tasks, deadlines and Information for Xena fields.

Use **Import JSON** to restore a dashboard backup created by this app. The import
checks that the file has the required top-level `state` structure, then asks for
explicit confirmation before replacing the current browser's local data.

The text export is for sharing the Information for Xena notes only. It is not a
full dashboard backup.

## Deployment

This dashboard is currently maintained for local-only use. Do not deploy or
connect it to practice systems without explicit practice approval.
